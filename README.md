## About:
Standard telephone keypads contain the digits zero through nine. The numbers two through nine each have three 
letters associated with them. Many people find it difficult to memorize phone numbers, so they use the correspondence
between digits and letters to develop seven-letter words that correspond to their phone numbers. For example, a person
whose telephone number is 686-2377 might use to develop the seven-letter word “NUMBERS.” Every seven-letter word 
corresponds to exactly one seven-digit telephone number. A restaurant wishing to increase its takeout business could 
surely do so with the number 825-3688 (i.e., “TAKEOUT”).<br>
Every seven-letter phone number corresponds to many different seven letter words, but most of these words represent unrecognizable juxtapositions of letters. It’s possible, 
however, that the owner of a barbershop would be pleased to know that the shop’s telephone number, 424-7288, corresponds
to “HAIRCUT.” A veterinarian with the phone number 738-2273 would be pleased to know that the number corresponds to the
letters “PETCARE.” An automotive dealership would be pleased to know that the dealership number, 639-2277, corresponds
to “NEWCARS.”<br>

Write a program with GUI that, given a seven-digit number, uses a Formatter object to write to a file every possible seven-letter
word combination corresponding to that number. There are 2,187 such combinations.<br>
Avoid phone numbers with the digits 0 and 1.
